📌 Project Overview
FitPic is a responsive web application that provides personalized clothing recommendations using AI-powered image analysis.
During authentication, the system captures a user image and analyzes visual attributes such as:
Skin tone
Face shape
Hair color
Eye type
Using these extracted attributes, FitPic intelligently generates clothing pairs from different fashion brands and assigns a compatibility score (e.g., 80% match). The system then recommends the best-matching outfit combinations tailored specifically to the user.
FitPic aims to simplify online fashion decisions and increase user confidence before purchasing.
🚀 Problem Statement
Online shoppers often struggle to determine:
Which colors suit their skin tone
Which styles match their facial structure
Which clothing combinations work well together
Most e-commerce platforms provide generic recommendations that do not consider personal attributes.
FitPic solves this by offering data-driven, personalized styling recommendations.
